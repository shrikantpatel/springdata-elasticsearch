# springdata-elasticsearch
This POC project that demostrates  use of springdata with elastic search

Springboot 1.5.9 uses spring data elasticsearch 2.x, which means we can only use the elastic search version 2.x.

Springboot 2.x uses spring data elasticsearch 3.x. This can support elasticsearch version 5 and 6.
